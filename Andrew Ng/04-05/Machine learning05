1. Overfitting
1.1 underfitting
Underfitting, or high bias, is when the form of our hypothesis function h maps poorly to the trend of the data. It is usually caused by a function that is too simple or uses too few features.
也就是说最终确定的模型误差太大

1.2 Overfitting
At the other extreme, overfitting, or high variance, is caused by a hypothesis function that fits the available data but does not generalize well to predict new data. It is usually caused by a complicated function that creates a lot of unnecessary curves and angles unrelated to the data.
简单来说就是：过拟合在traning data 中效果非常好，但是一到预测时，效果非常差。
