Gradient Descent:	

1. Need to choose step length.

2. Needs many iterations.

3. Works well even when the number of features n is large.

But we need to take some efforts to select the crrect step length.


Normal Equation

1. No need to choose step length.

2. No needs many iterations.

3. Need	to compute the inverse of X thranspose *X

4. Slow	if the number of features n is large.	

Note: Generally, n>10000, use Gradient Descent while n<10000, use Normal Equation.


If X thranspose *X is non-­‐invertible(singular), what is thesolution?
